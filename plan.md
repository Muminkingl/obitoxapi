# File Upload API

Simplify file uploads for developers by wrapping complex storage provider APIs into **3–7 lines of code**.

---

## Core Architecture

```

Developer’s App → Your API → Storage Provider (AWS / Vercel / etc.)
↑
(Generates Signed URLs)

````

---

## Key API Endpoints

### 1. Authentication
```http
POST /auth/validate
````

* Validates the developer’s API key (from your dashboard).

### 2. Upload URL Generation

```http
POST /upload/signed-url
{
  "filename": "photo.jpg",
  "provider": "aws",
  "credentials": { "accessKey": "...", "bucket": "..." }
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "uploadUrl": "https://s3.amazon.com/...",
  "fileUrl": "https://cdn.amazon.com/photo.jpg"
}
```

### 3. Usage Tracking

```http
POST /analytics/track
```

* Logs upload events for dashboard analytics.

---

## Workflow

1. Developer calls your API with file information.
2. Your API generates a **signed upload URL** using the developer’s storage credentials.
3. The app uploads the file **directly to the storage provider**.

   * File never touches your servers → **zero bandwidth cost**.
4. Your API tracks usage for billing and analytics.

---

## Why Use This API

* Handles all complex tasks (signed URLs, multiple provider APIs).
* Provides a **simple, unified interface** for developers.
* Saves hours of dealing with AWS/storage APIs.
* Monetization: charge **\$4/month** for convenience and simplicity.
